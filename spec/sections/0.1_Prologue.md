**0.1** **Prologue**


This clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.


As the costs for both processing power and memory have reduced, network support for coded video data has diversified,
and advances in video coding technology have progressed, the need has arisen for an industry standard for compressed
video representation with substantially increased coding efficiency and enhanced robustness to network environments.
Toward these ends the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group
(MPEG) formed a Joint Video Team (JVT) in 2001 for development of a new Recommendation | International Standard.
The standard has since been maintained and enhanced jointly by VCEG and MPEG.
