**0.5** **Profiles and levels**


This clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.


This Recommendation | International Standard is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide range of
applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities, and services. Applications should cover, among other things, digital storage
media, television broadcasting and real-time communications. In the course of creating this Specification, various
requirements from typical applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements have been developed, and
these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence, this Specification will facilitate video data interchange among
different applications.


Considering the practicality of implementing the full syntax of this Specification, however, a limited number of subsets of
the syntax are also stipulated by means of "profiles" and "levels". These and other related terms are formally defined in
clause 3.


A "profile" is a subset of the entire bitstream syntax that is specified by this Recommendation | International Standard.
Within the bounds imposed by the syntax of a given profile it is still possible to require a very large variation in the
performance of encoders and decoders depending upon the values taken by syntax elements in the bitstream such as the





specified size of the decoded pictures. In many applications, it is currently neither practical nor economic to implement a
decoder capable of dealing with all hypothetical uses of the syntax within a particular profile.


In order to deal with this problem, "levels" are specified within each profile. A level is a specified set of constraints imposed
on values of the syntax elements in the bitstream. These constraints may be simple limits on values. Alternatively they
may take the form of constraints on arithmetic combinations of values (e.g., picture width multiplied by picture height
multiplied by number of pictures decoded per second).


Coded video content conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard uses a common syntax. In order to
achieve a subset of the complete syntax, flags, parameters, and other syntax elements are included in the bitstream that
signal the presence or absence of syntactic elements that occur later in the bitstream.
