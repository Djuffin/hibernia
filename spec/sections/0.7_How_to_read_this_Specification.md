**0.7** **How to read this Specification**


This clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.


It is suggested that the reader starts with clause 1 (Scope) and moves on to clause 3 (Definitions). Clause 6 should be read
for the geometrical relationship of the source, input, and output of the decoder. Clause 7 (Syntax and semantics) specifies





the order to parse syntax elements from the bitstream. See clauses 7.1 to 7.3 for syntactical order and see clause 7.4 for
semantics; i.e., the scope, restrictions, and conditions that are imposed on the syntax elements. The actual parsing for most
syntax elements is specified in clause 9 (Parsing process). Finally, clause 8 (Decoding process) specifies how the syntax
elements are mapped into decoded samples. Throughout reading this Specification, the reader should refer to clauses 2
(Normative references), 4 (Abbreviations), and 5 (Conventions) as needed. Annexes A through E, G, and H also form an
integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.


Annex A specifies fourteen profiles (Baseline, Constrained Baseline, Main, Extended, High, Progressive High,
Constrained High, High 10, High 4:2:2, High 4:4:4 Predictive, High 10 Intra, High 4:2:2 Intra, High 4:4:4 Intra, and
CAVLC 4:4:4 Intra), each being tailored to certain application domains, and defines the so-called levels of the profiles.
Annex B specifies syntax and semantics of a byte stream format for delivery of coded video as an ordered stream of bytes.
Annex C specifies the hypothetical reference decoder and its use to check bitstream and decoder conformance. Annex D
specifies syntax and semantics for supplemental enhancement information message payloads. Annex E specifies syntax
and semantics of the video usability information parameters of the sequence parameter set.


Annex G specifies scalable video coding (SVC). The reader is referred to Annex G for the entire decoding process for
SVC, which is specified there with references being made to clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes A to E. Clause G.10 specifies five
profiles for SVC (Scalable Baseline, Scalable Constrained Baseline, Scalable High, Scalable Constrained High, and
Scalable High Intra).


Annex H specifies multiview video coding (MVC) and multi-resolution frame compatible stereo coding (MFC). The reader
is referred to Annex H for the entire decoding process for MVC and MFC, which is specified there with references being
made to clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes A to E. Clause H.10 specifies two profiles for MVC (Multiview High and Stereo High)
and one profile for MFC (MFC High).


Annex I specifies MVC extensions for inclusion of depth maps, referred to as multiview video coding with depth (MVCD).
The reader is referred to Annex I for the entire decoding process for MVCD, which is specified there with references being
made to clauses 2 to 9, Annexes A to E and Annex H. Clause I.10 specifies two profiles for MVCD (Multiview Depth
High and MFC Depth High).


Annex J specifies a multiview video coding extension with depth information (3D-AVC). The reader is referred to Annex J
for the entire decoding process for 3D-AVC, which is specified there with references being made to clauses 2 to 9 and
Annexes A to E and H to I. Clause J.10 specifies one profile for 3D-AVC.


Throughout this Specification, statements appearing with the preamble "NOTE -" are informative and are not an integral
part of this Recommendation | International Standard.
