**5.10** **Text description of logical operations**


In the text, a statement of logical operations as would be described in pseudo-code as


if( condition 0 )
statement 0
else if ( condition 1 )
statement 1
…
else /* informative remark on remaining condition */
statement n


may be described in the following manner:

... as follows / ... the following applies:

      - If condition 0, statement 0

      - Otherwise, if condition 1, statement 1

      - …

      - Otherwise (informative remark on remaining condition), statement n


Each "If ... Otherwise, if ... Otherwise, ..." statement in the text is introduced with "... as follows" or "... the following
applies" immediately followed by "If ... ". The last condition of the "If ... Otherwise, if ... Otherwise, ..." is always an
"Otherwise, ...". Interleaved "If ... Otherwise, if ... Otherwise, ..." statements can be identified by matching "... as follows"
or "... the following applies" with the ending "Otherwise, ...".
