**5.1** **Arithmetic operators**


The following arithmetic operators are defined as follows:

+ Addition

    - Subtraction (as a two-argument operator) or negation (as a unary prefix operator)

    - Multiplication, including matrix multiplication

x [y] Exponentiation. Specifies x to the power of y. In other contexts, such notation is used for superscripting
not intended for interpretation as exponentiation.

/ Integer division with truncation of the result toward zero. For example, 7/4 and −7/−4 are truncated to 1
and −7/4 and 7/−4 are truncated to −1.

÷ Used to denote division in mathematical equations where no truncation or rounding is intended.

_x_
Used to denote division in mathematical equations where no truncation or rounding is intended.
_y_



_y_



_f_ ( _i_ ) The summation of f( i ) with i taking all integer values from x up to and including y.


#### 

_i_ = _x_



=



x % y Modulus. Remainder of x divided by y, defined only for integers x and y with x >= 0 and y > 0.
