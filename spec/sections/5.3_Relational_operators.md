**5.3** **Relational operators**


The following relational operators are defined as follows:

 Greater than.

= Greater than or equal to.

 Less than.

= Less than or equal to.

= = Equal to.

! = Not equal to.


When a relational operator is applied to a syntax element or variable that has been assigned the value "na" (not applicable),
the value "na" is treated as a distinct value for the syntax element or variable. The value "na" is considered not to be equal
to any other value.
