**5.4** **Bit-wise operators**


The following bit-wise operators are defined as follows:

& Bit-wise "and". When operating on integer arguments, operates on a two's complement representation of
the integer value. When operating on a binary argument that contains fewer bits than another argument,
the shorter argument is extended by adding more significant bits equal to 0.

| Bit-wise "or". When operating on integer arguments, operates on a two's complement representation of
the integer value. When operating on a binary argument that contains fewer bits than another argument,
the shorter argument is extended by adding more significant bits equal to 0.

^ Bit-wise "exclusive or". When operating on integer arguments, operates on a two's complement
representation of the integer value. When operating on a binary argument that contains fewer bits than
another argument, the shorter argument is extended by adding more significant bits equal to 0.

x >> y Arithmetic right shift of a two's complement integer representation of x by y binary digits. This function
is defined only for positive integer values of y. Bits shifted into the MSBs as a result of the right shift
have a value equal to the MSB of x prior to the shift operation.

x << y Arithmetic left shift of a two's complement integer representation of x by y binary digits. This function
is defined only for positive integer values of y. Bits shifted into the LSBs as a result of the left shift have
a value equal to 0.
