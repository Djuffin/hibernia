**5.5** **Assignment operators**


The following arithmetic operators are defined as follows:

= Assignment operator.

++ Increment, i.e., _x_ ++ is equivalent to _x_ = _x_ + 1; when used in an array index, evaluates to the value of the
variable prior to the increment operation.

−− Decrement, i.e., _x_ −− is equivalent to _x_ = _x_    - 1; when used in an array index, evaluates to the value of the
variable prior to the decrement operation.

+= Increment by amount specified, i.e., x += 3 is equivalent to x = x + 3, and x += (−3) is equivalent
to x = x + (−3).

−= Decrement by amount specified, i.e., x −= 3 is equivalent to x = x − 3, and x −= (−3) is equivalent
to x = x − (−3).
