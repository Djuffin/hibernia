**5.8** **Order of operation precedence**


When order of precedence in an expression is not indicated explicitly by use of parentheses, the following rules apply:

- operations of a higher precedence are evaluated before any operation of a lower precedence,

- operations of the same precedence are evaluated sequentially from left to right.


Table 5-1 specifies the precedence of operations from highest to lowest; a higher position in the table indicates a higher
precedence.

NOTE – For those operators that are also used in the C programming language, the order of precedence used in this Specification is
the same as used in the C programming language.


**Table 5-1 – Operation precedence from highest (at top of table) to lowest (at bottom of table)**
