**5.9** **Variables, syntax elements, and tables**


Syntax elements in the bitstream are represented in **bold** type. Each syntax element is described by its name (all lower case
letters with underscore characters), its one or two syntax categories, and one or two descriptors for its method of coded
representation. The decoding process behaves according to the value of the syntax element and to the values of previously
decoded syntax elements. When a value of a syntax element is used in the syntax tables or the text, it appears in regular
(i.e., not bold) type.


In some cases the syntax tables may use the values of other variables derived from syntax elements values. Such variables
appear in the syntax tables, or text, named by a mixture of lower case and upper case letter and without any underscore
characters. Variables starting with an upper case letter are derived for the decoding of the current syntax structure and all
depending syntax structures. Variables starting with an upper case letter may be used in the decoding process for later





syntax structures without mentioning the originating syntax structure of the variable. Variables starting with a lower case
letter are only used within the clause in which they are derived.


In some cases, "mnemonic" names for syntax element values or variable values are used interchangeably with their
numerical values. Sometimes "mnemonic" names are used without any associated numerical values. The association of
values and names is specified in the text. The names are constructed from one or more groups of letters separated by an
underscore character. Each group starts with an upper case letter and may contain more upper case letters.

NOTE – The syntax is described in a manner that closely follows the C-language syntactic constructs.


Functions that specify properties of the current position in the bitstream are referred to as syntax functions. These functions
are specified in clause 7.2 and assume the existence of a bitstream pointer with an indication of the position of the next bit
to be read by the decoding process from the bitstream. Syntax functions are described by their names, which are constructed
as syntax element names and end with left and right round parentheses including zero or more variable names (for
definition) or values (for usage), separated by commas (if more than one variable).


Functions that are not syntax functions (including mathematical functions specified in clause 5.7) are described by their
names, which start with an upper case letter, contain a mixture of lower and upper case letters without any underscore
character, and end with left and right parentheses including zero or more variable names (for definition) or values (for
usage) separated by commas (if more than one variable).


Subscripts or square parentheses are used for the indexing of arrays. In reference to a visual depiction of a matrix, the first
subscript is used as a row (vertical) index and the second subscript is used as a column (horizontal) index. The indexing
order is reversed when using square parentheses rather than subscripts for indexing. Thus, an element of a matrix s at
horizontal position x and vertical position y may be denoted either as s[ x, y ] or as syx.


Binary notation is indicated by enclosing the string of bit values by single quote marks. For example, '01000001' represents
an eight-bit string having only its second and its last bits (counted from the most to the least significant bit) equal to 1.


Hexadecimal notation, indicated by prefixing the hexadecimal number by "0x", may be used instead of binary notation
when the number of bits is an integer multiple of 4. For example, 0x41 represents an eight-bit string having only its second
and its last bits (counted from the most to the least significant bit) equal to 1.


Numerical values not enclosed in single quotes and not prefixed by "0x" are decimal values.


A value equal to 0 represents a FALSE condition in a test statement. The value TRUE is represented by any value different
from zero.
