**6.1** **Bitstream formats**


This clause specifies the relationship between the NAL unit stream and byte stream, either of which are referred to as the
bitstream.


The bitstream can be in one of two formats: the NAL unit stream format or the byte stream format. The NAL unit stream
format is conceptually the more "basic" type. It consists of a sequence of syntax structures called NAL units. This sequence
is ordered in decoding order. There are constraints imposed on the decoding order (and contents) of the NAL units in the
NAL unit stream.


The byte stream format can be constructed from the NAL unit stream format by ordering the NAL units in decoding order
and prefixing each NAL unit with a start code prefix and zero or more zero-valued bytes to form a stream of bytes. The





NAL unit stream format can be extracted from the byte stream format by searching for the location of the unique start code
prefix pattern within this stream of bytes. Methods of framing the NAL units in a manner other than use of the byte stream
format are outside the scope of this Recommendation | International Standard. The byte stream format is specified in
Annex B.
