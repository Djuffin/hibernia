**6.3** **Spatial subdivision of pictures and slices**


This clause specifies how a picture is partitioned into slices and macroblocks. Pictures are divided into slices. A slice is a
sequence of macroblocks, or, when macroblock-adaptive frame/field decoding is in use, a sequence of macroblock pairs.


Each macroblock is comprised of one 16x16 luma array and, when the chroma sampling format is not equal to 4:0:0 and
separate_colour_plane_flag is equal to 0, two corresponding chroma sample arrays. When separate_colour_plane_flag is
equal to 1, each macroblock is comprised of one 16x16 luma or chroma sample array. When macroblock-adaptive
frame/field decoding is not in use, each macroblock represents a spatial rectangular region of the picture. For example, a
picture may be divided into two slices as shown in Figure 6-7.


When a picture is coded using three separate colour planes (separate_colour_plane_flag is equal to 1), a slice contains only
macroblocks of one colour component being identified by the corresponding value of colour_plane_id, and each colour
component array of a picture consists of slices having the same colour_plane_id value. Coded slices with different values
of colour_plane_id within an access unit can be interleaved with each other under the constraint that for each value of
colour_plane_id, the coded slice NAL units with that value colour_plane_id shall be in the order of increasing macroblock
address for the first macroblock of each coded slice NAL unit.

NOTE – When separate_colour_plane_flag is equal to 0, each macroblock of a picture is contained in exactly one slice. When
separate_colour_plane_flag is equal to 1, each macroblock of a colour component is contained in exactly one slice (i.e., information
for each macroblock of a picture is present in exactly three slices and these three slices have different values of colour_plane_id).


**Figure 6-7 – A picture with 11 by 9 macroblocks that is partitioned into two slices**


When macroblock-adaptive frame/field decoding is in use, the picture is partitioned into slices containing an integer
number of macroblock pairs as shown in Figure 6-8. Each macroblock pair consists of two macroblocks.
