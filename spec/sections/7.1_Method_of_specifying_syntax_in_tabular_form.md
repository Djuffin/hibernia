**7.1** **Method of specifying syntax in tabular form**


The syntax tables specify a superset of the syntax of all allowed bitstreams. Additional constraints on the syntax may be
specified, either directly or indirectly, in other clauses.

NOTE – An actual decoder should implement means for identifying entry points into the bitstream and means to identify and handle
non-conforming bitstreams. The methods for identifying and handling errors and other such situations are not specified here.


The following table lists examples of pseudo code used to describe the syntax. When **syntax_element** appears, it specifies
that a syntax element is parsed from the bitstream and the bitstream pointer is advanced to the next position beyond the
syntax element in the bitstream parsing process.
