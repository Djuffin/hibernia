**7.2** **Specification of syntax functions, categories, and descriptors**


The functions presented here are used in the syntactical description. These functions assume the existence of a bitstream
pointer with an indication of the position of the next bit to be read by the decoding process from the bitstream.


byte_aligned( ) is specified as follows:


   - If the current position in the bitstream is on a byte boundary, i.e., the next bit in the bitstream is the first bit in a
byte, the return value of byte_aligned( ) is equal to TRUE.


   - Otherwise, the return value of byte_aligned( ) is equal to FALSE.


more_data_in_byte_stream( ), which is used only in the byte stream NAL unit syntax structure specified in Annex B, is
specified as follows:


   - If more data follow in the byte stream, the return value of more_data_in_byte_stream( ) is equal to TRUE.


   - Otherwise, the return value of more_data_in_byte_stream( ) is equal to FALSE.


more_rbsp_data( ) is specified as follows:


   - If there is no more data in the RBSP, the return value of more_rbsp_data( ) is equal to FALSE.


   - Otherwise, the RBSP data is searched for the last (least significant, right-most) bit equal to 1 that is present in the
RBSP. Given the position of this bit, which is the first bit (rbsp_stop_one_bit) of the rbsp_trailing_bits( ) syntax
structure, the following applies:


     - If there is more data in an RBSP before the rbsp_trailing_bits( ) syntax structure, the return value of
more_rbsp_data( ) is equal to TRUE.


     - Otherwise, the return value of more_rbsp_data( ) is equal to FALSE.


The method for enabling determination of whether there is more data in the RBSP is specified by the application (or
in Annex B for applications that use the byte stream format).


more_rbsp_trailing_data( ) is specified as follows:


   - If there is more data in an RBSP, the return value of more_rbsp_trailing_data( ) is equal to TRUE.


   - Otherwise, the return value of more_rbsp_trailing_data( ) is equal to FALSE.


next_bits( n ) provides the next bits in the bitstream for comparison purposes, without advancing the bitstream pointer.
Provides a look at the next n bits in the bitstream with n being its argument. When used within the byte stream as specified
in Annex B, next_bits( n ) returns a value of 0 if fewer than n bits remain within the byte stream.


read_bits( n ) reads the next n bits from the bitstream and advances the bitstream pointer by n bit positions. When n is
equal to 0, read_bits( n ) is specified to return a value equal to 0 and to not advance the bitstream pointer.


Categories (labelled in the table as **C** ) specify the partitioning of slice data into at most three slice data partitions. Slice
data partition A contains all syntax elements of category 2. Slice data partition B contains all syntax elements of category 3.
Slice data partition C contains all syntax elements of category 4. The meaning of other category values is not specified.
For some syntax elements, two category values, separated by a vertical bar, are used. In these cases, the category value to
be applied is further specified in the text. For syntax structures used within other syntax structures, the categories of all
syntax elements found within the included syntax structure are listed, separated by a vertical bar. A syntax element or
syntax structure with category marked as "All" is present within all syntax structures that include that syntax element or
syntax structure. For syntax structures used within other syntax structures, a numeric category value provided in a syntax
table at the location of the inclusion of a syntax structure containing a syntax element with category marked as "All" is
considered to apply to the syntax elements with category "All".





The following descriptors specify the parsing process of each syntax element. For some syntax elements, two descriptors,
separated by a vertical bar, are used. In these cases, the left descriptors apply when entropy_coding_mode_flag is equal
to 0 and the right descriptor applies when entropy_coding_mode_flag is equal to 1.


   - ae(v): context-adaptive arithmetic entropy-coded syntax element. The parsing process for this descriptor is
specified in clause 9.3.


   - b(8): byte having any pattern of bit string (8 bits). The parsing process for this descriptor is specified by the return
value of the function read_bits( 8 ).


   - ce(v): context-adaptive variable-length entropy-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process
for this descriptor is specified in clause 9.2.


   - f(n): fixed-pattern bit string using n bits written (from left to right) with the left bit first. The parsing process for
this descriptor is specified by the return value of the function read_bits( n ).


   - i(n): signed integer using n bits. When n is "v" in the syntax table, the number of bits varies in a manner dependent
on the value of other syntax elements. The parsing process for this descriptor is specified by the return value of
the function read_bits( n ) interpreted as a two's complement integer representation with most significant bit
written first.


   - me(v): mapped Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process for this descriptor
is specified in clause 9.1.


   - se(v): signed integer Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process for this
descriptor is specified in clause 9.1.


   - st(v): null-terminated string encoded as universal coded character set (UCS) transmission format-8 (UTF-8)
characters as specified in ISO/IEC 10646. The parsing process is specified as follows: st(v) begins at a bytealigned position in the bitstream and reads and returns a series of bytes from the bitstream, beginning at the current
position and continuing up to but not including the next byte-aligned byte that is equal to 0x00, and advances the
bitstream pointer by ( stringLength + 1 ) * 8 bit positions, where stringLength is equal to the number of bytes
returned.

NOTE – The st(v) syntax descriptor is only used in this Specification when the current position in the bitstream is a bytealigned position.


   - te(v): truncated Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with left bit first. The parsing process for this descriptor is
specified in clause 9.1.


   - u(n): unsigned integer using n bits. When n is "v" in the syntax table, the number of bits varies in a manner
dependent on the value of other syntax elements. The parsing process for this descriptor is specified by the return
value of the function read_bits( n ) interpreted as a binary representation of an unsigned integer with most
significant bit written first.


   - ue(v): unsigned integer Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process for this
descriptor is specified in clause 9.1.
