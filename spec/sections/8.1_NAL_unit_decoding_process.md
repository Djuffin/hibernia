**8.1** **NAL unit decoding process**


Inputs to this process are NAL units.


Outputs of this process are the RBSP syntax structures encapsulated within the NAL units.


The decoding process for each NAL unit extracts the RBSP syntax structure from the NAL unit and then operates the
decoding processes specified for the RBSP syntax structure in the NAL unit as follows.


Clause 8.2 describes the decoding process for NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 through 5.


Clause 8.3 describes the decoding process for a macroblock or part of a macroblock coded in NAL units with nal_unit_type
equal to 1, 2, and 5.


Clause 8.4 describes the decoding process for a macroblock or part of a macroblock coded in NAL units with nal_unit_type
equal to 1 and 2.


Clause 8.5 describes the decoding process for a macroblock or part of a macroblock coded in NAL units with nal_unit_type
equal to 1 and 3 to 5.


Clause 8.6 describes the decoding process for a macroblock or part of a macroblock coded in NAL units with nal_unit_type
equal to 1 and 3 to 5.


Clause 8.7 describes the decoding process for a macroblock or part of a macroblock coded in NAL units with nal_unit_type
equal to 1 to 5.


NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 7 and 8 contain sequence parameter sets and picture parameter sets, respectively.
Picture parameter sets are used in the decoding processes of other NAL units as determined by reference to a picture
parameter set within the slice headers of each picture. Sequence parameter sets are used in the decoding processes of other
NAL units as determined by reference to a sequence parameter set within the picture parameter sets of each sequence.


No normative decoding process is specified for NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
