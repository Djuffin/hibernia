**A.1** **Requirements on video decoder capability**


Capabilities of video decoders conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard are specified in terms of the
ability to decode video streams conforming to the constraints of profiles and levels specified in this annex. For each such
profile, the level supported for that profile shall also be expressed.


Specific values are specified in this annex for the syntax elements profile_idc and level_idc. All other values of profile_idc
and level_idc are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC.

NOTE – Decoders should not infer that when a reserved value of profile_idc or level_idc falls between the values specified in this
Recommendation | International Standard that this indicates intermediate capabilities between the specified profiles or levels, as
there are no restrictions on the method to be chosen by ITU-T | ISO/IEC for the use of such future reserved values.
