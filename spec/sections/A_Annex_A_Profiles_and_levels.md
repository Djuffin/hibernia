**Annex A**


**Profiles and levels**


(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.)


Profiles and levels specify restrictions on bitstreams and hence limits on the capabilities needed to decode the bitstreams.
Profiles and levels may also be used to indicate interoperability points between individual decoder implementations.

NOTE 1 – This Recommendation | International Standard does not include individually selectable "options" at the decoder, as this
would increase interoperability difficulties.


Each profile specifies a subset of algorithmic features and limits that shall be supported by all decoders conforming to that
profile.

NOTE 2 – Encoders are not required to make use of any particular subset of features supported in a profile.


Each level specifies a set of limits on the values that may be taken by the syntax elements of this
Recommendation | International Standard. The same set of level definitions is used with all profiles, but individual
implementations may support a different level for each supported profile. For any given profile, levels generally correspond
to decoder processing load and memory capability.


The profiles that are specified in clause A.2 are also referred to as the profiles specified in Annex A.
