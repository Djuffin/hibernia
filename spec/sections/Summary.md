**Summary**


Recommendation ITU-T H.264 | International Standard ISO/IEC 14496-10 represents an evolution of the existing video
coding standards (ITU-T H.261, ITU-T H.262, and ITU-T H.263) and it was developed in response to the growing need
for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications such as videoconferencing, digital storage media,
television broadcasting, Internet streaming, and communication. It is also designed to enable the use of the coded video
representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network environments. The use of this Recommendation |
International Standard allows motion video to be manipulated as a form of computer data and to be stored on various
storage media, transmitted and received over existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future
broadcasting channels.


The 1 [st] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 was approved in 2003-05.


Corrigendum 1 to the 1 [st] version of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2004-05, included various minor corrections and
clarifications. This corrigendum was never published independently, its content having been included in the 1 [st] published
edition.


The 2 [nd] edition of ITU-T H.264, approved in 2005-03, contained modifications of the video coding standard to add four
new profiles, referred to as the High, High 10, High 4:2:2, and High 4:4:4 profiles, to improve video quality capability and
to extend the range of applications addressed by the standard (for example, by including support for a greater range of
picture sample precision and higher-resolution chroma formats). Additionally, a definition of new types of supplemental
data was specified to further broaden the applicability of the video coding standard. Finally, a number of corrections to
errors in the published text were included.


Corrigendum 1 to the 2 [nd] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2005-09, corrected and updated various minor aspects
to bring the ITU-T version of the text up to date relative to the 2005-04 output status approved as a new edition of the
corresponding jointly-developed and technically-aligned text ISO/IEC 14496-10. It additionally fixed a number of minor
errors and needs for clarification and defined three previously-reserved sample aspect ratio indicators. This corrigendum
was never published independently, its content having been included in the 2 [nd] published edition, which was published in
2005-11.


Amendment 1, "Support of additional colour spaces and removal of the High 4:4:4 Profile", approved in 2006-06, contained
alterations to Rec. ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10, Advanced Video Coding, to specify the support of additional colour
spaces and to remove the definition of the High 4:4:4 profile.


Amendment 2, "New profiles for professional applications", approved in 2007-04, contained extensions to
Rec. ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 Advanced Video Coding to specify the support of five additional profiles intended
primarily for professional applications (the High 10 Intra, High 4:2:2 Intra, High 4:4:4 Intra, CAVLC 4:4:4 Intra, and
High 4:4:4 Predictive profiles) and two new types of supplemental enhancement information (SEI) messages (the postfilter hint SEI message and the tone mapping information SEI message).


Amendment 3, "Scalable video coding", approved in 2007-11 in an integrated 3 [rd] ITU-T H.264 edition, contained
extensions to Rec. ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10, Advanced Video Coding, to specify a scalable video coding extension
in three profiles (the Scalable Baseline, Scalable High, and Scalable High Intra profiles).


ITU-T H.264 (2005) Amd.2 (2007) was available only as pre-published text since it was superseded by ITU-T H.264
Amd.3 (2007-11) before its publication. Furthermore, ITU-T H.264 Amd.3 was not published separately. The changes
introduced by the three amendments were integrated into the 3 [rd] ITU-T H.264 edition, which was approved in 2007-11.


Corrigendum 1 to the 2 [nd] edition, approved in 2009-01, provided a significant number of minor corrections, clarifications,
consistency improvements and formatting improvements drafted in response to accumulated errata reports collected since
publication of the 2 [nd] edition (dated 2005-03, which included a Cor.1 approved in 2005-09).


The 4 [th] edition of ITU-T H.264, approved in 2009-05, contained enhancement extensions to support multiview video
coding (MVC), specification of a "Constrained Baseline Profile", and some miscellaneous corrections and clarifications.


The 5 [th] edition of ITU-T H.264, approved in 2010-03, contained the specification of a new profile (the Stereo High profile)
for two-view video coding with support of interlaced coding tools, the specification a new SEI message (the frame packing
arrangement SEI message), and some miscellaneous corrections and clarifications.


The 6 [th] edition of ITU-T H.264, approved in 2011-07, contained the specification of a new level (Level 5.2) supporting
higher processing rates in terms of maximum macroblocks per second, a new profile (the Progressive High profile) to
enable implementation of decoders supporting only the frame coding tools of the previously specified High profile, and
included miscellaneous corrections and clarifications.

The 7 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2012-01, contained the specification of three additional profiles intended
primarily for communication applications (the Constrained High, Scalable Constrained Baseline, and Scalable Constrained
High profiles).


The 8 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2013-04, contained an additional profile for multiview video coding with
depth information (the Multiview Depth High profile), and contained additional SEI message enhancements, additional
colorimetry identifiers, and corrections and clarifications.


The 9 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2014-02 specified multi-resolution frame-compatible (MFC)
enhancement for stereoscopic video coding, including the specification of an additional profile, the MFC High profile, an
enhanced profile for combined multiview video coding with depth information (the Enhanced Multiview Depth High
profile), and includes miscellaneous minor corrections and clarifications.


The 10 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2016-02 specified MFC stereoscopic video with depth maps, including
the specification of an additional profile, the MFC Depth High profile, and the mastering display colour volume SEI
message, additional colour-related video usability information codepoint identifiers, and miscellaneous minor corrections
and clarifications.


The 11 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2016-10, specified additional levels of decoder capability supporting
larger picture sizes (Levels 6, 6.1, and 6.2), the green metadata SEI message, the alternative depth information SEI
message, additional colour-related video usability information codepoint identifiers, and miscellaneous minor corrections
and clarifications.


The 12 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2017-04, specified the Progressive High 10 profile; support for
additional colour-related indicators including the hybrid log-gamma transfer characteristics indication, the alternative
transfer characteristics SEI message, the ICTCP colour matrix transformation, chromaticity-derived constant luminance
and non-constant luminance colour matrix coefficients, the colour remapping information SEI message; and miscellaneous
minor corrections and clarifications.


The 13 [th] edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2019-06, specified additional SEI messages for ambient viewing
environment, content light level information, content colour volume, equirectangular projection, cubemap projection,
sphere rotation, region-wise packing, omnidirectional viewport, SEI manifest, and SEI prefix, and miscellaneous minor
