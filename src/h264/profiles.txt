Baseline profile
Bitstreams conforming to the Baseline profile shall obey the following constraints:
– Only I and P slice types may be present.
– NAL unit streams shall not contain nal_unit_type values in the range of 2 to 4, inclusive.
– Sequence parameter sets shall have frame_mbs_only_flag equal to 1.
– The syntax elements chroma_format_idc, bit_depth_luma_minus8, bit_depth_chroma_minus8,
   qpprime_y_zero_transform_bypass_flag, and seq_scaling_matrix_present_flag shall not be present in sequence
   parameter sets.
– Picture parameter sets shall have weighted_pred_flag and weighted_bipred_idc both equal to 0.
– Picture parameter sets shall have entropy_coding_mode_flag equal to 0.
– Picture parameter sets shall have num_slice_groups_minus1 in the range of 0 to 7, inclusive.
– The syntax elements transform_8x8_mode_flag, pic_scaling_matrix_present_flag, and
   second_chroma_qp_index_offset shall not be present in picture parameter sets.
– The syntax element level_prefix shall not be greater than 15 (when present).
– The syntax elements pcm_sample_luma[ i ], with i = 0..255, and pcm_sample_chroma[ i ], with
   i = 0..2 * MbWidthC * MbHeightC − 1, shall not be equal to 0 (when present).
– The level constraints specified for the Baseline profile in clause A.3 shall be fulfilled.

Conformance of a bitstream to the Baseline profile is indicated by profile_idc being equal to 66.
Decoders conforming to the Baseline profile at a specific level shall be capable of decoding all
bitstreams in which profile_idc is equal to 66 or constraint_set0_flag is equal to 1 and in which
level_idc and constraint_set3_flag represent a level less than or equal to the specified level.
