# `table_9-5.rs` - CAVLC `TotalCoeff` and `T1s` Table

This file contains a static table used in the Context-Adaptive Variable-Length Coding (CAVLC) decoding process. This table corresponds to **Table 9-5** in the ITU-T H.241 specification, which defines the variable-length codes for the `TotalCoeff` and `T1s` (trailing ones) syntax elements.

## Purpose

This table is used to jointly decode the number of non-zero coefficients (`TotalCoeff`) and the number of trailing ones (`T1s`) in a residual block. A "trailing one" is a coefficient with a value of +1 or -1 that occurs at the end of the coefficient list.

The table is indexed by the `nC` value, which is a context-dependent parameter that indicates the number of non-zero coefficients in neighboring blocks. The `nC` value is used to select the appropriate set of VLC codes from the table.

## Structure

The file contains a single static array of tuples. Each tuple has the following structure:

```rust
((TotalCoeff, T1s), (code_for_nC_0_to_1, code_for_nC_2_to_3, ...))
```

- `(TotalCoeff, T1s)`: A tuple representing the decoded values.
- `code_for_nC_...`: A tuple `(code, length)` representing the VLC code for a specific range of `nC` values.
  - `code`: The binary code.
  - `length`: The length of the code in bits.

This table is a key component of the CAVLC parsing process, as it allows for the efficient decoding of two important syntax elements in a single lookup.
